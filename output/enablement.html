 have observed certain usage patterns.
Trust - Users want to be sure they can trust the information that is presented to them.
UX - Ease of accesses - They do not want to go to multiple applications or even tabs in the browser when they are accessing the information. 
Graphical Context - It makes their decision making easier if they see the information in the graphics context. 
Access control - Not everyone in user organization needs or should be able to access all the information about the given asset.
Information approval - Usually there are approval patterns associated with the piece of information and users want to know if they are looking at the approved information. 
They also expect to streamline these information management patterns from same location where they are accessing the information from.</p>
<p>Someone wants to make a decision and they need right kind, and right amount of information at the right time so they can easily make the right decision at the time.</p>
<p>all the digital workflows emerge when we put concrete verbs and nouns in the above statement. But the fundamentals remain the same. </p>
<p>there is a user context, information context, work-flow context, action context. 
who is he? 
what kind of information is he looking for? 
how is he going to access the information?
what is he going to do with the information? 
does he have rights to access the information? 
does he have rights to act upon the information?</p>
<p>All of us, as an AEC software Industry, believe that digital twins could help us alleviate the situation here. Every software company is approaching it more or less in a same way. </p>
<p>Irrespective of the specific industry, there are certain patterns which emerge while using digital twins. User just wants the latest available information about a piece of asset irrespective of the application the information or part of it resides in. </p>
<p>At the most basic level there are patterns to </p>
<ol>
<li>make information accessible to the user</li>
<li>this could be form factor used to consume the information e.g. on a mobile device via an app, or on a desktop via a web portal </li>
<li>patterns to fetch or expose information out of the applications used to produce the information </li>
<li>pattern to align the information if parts of it reside in multiple applications </li>
<li>patterns to cache the information so that it can be quickly presented to the user</li>
<li>patterns to validate the information  </li>
<li>consumption of the information </li>
<li>patterns of behavior when asset it selected in a graphical UI </li>
<li>patterns to query and filter the information</li>
<li>patterns to ask questions about the information </li>
<li>patterns to discuss about the information </li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>these information access patterns depend upon following things </p>
<ul>
<li>the persona of the user accessing the information</li>
<li>the lifecycle stage of the asset - type of the information being accessed </li>
<li></li>
</ul>
