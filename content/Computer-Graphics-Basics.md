Pixels - 

At a given time, each pixel can show only one color. 

Pixel Color schemes 

24 bit color scheme - a color can be specified by three 8-bit numbers, giving the levels of red, green, and blue in the color.

grayscale - where each pixel is some shade of gray and the pixel color is given by one number that specifies the level of gray on a black-to-white scale. Typically, 256 shades of gray are used.


Frame Buffer 
color values for all the pixels on the screen are stored in a large block of memory known as a frame buffer.
The screen is redrawn many times per second, so that almost immediately after the color values are changed in the frame buffer, the colors of the pixels on the screen will be changed to match, and the displayed image will change.

Raster Graphics 
Pixel-based graphics in which an image is specified by assigning a color to each pixel in a grid of pixels.

Vector Graphics Shape-based graphics in which an image is specified as a list of the shapes or objects that appear in the image.
