    f :: A -> B
Double colon means “has the type of…” A function type is created by inserting an arrow between two types.

    g . f

You compose two functions by inserting a period between them (or a Unicode circle).

The **interact** function takes a function of type String->String as its argument. The entire input from the standard input device is passed to this function as its argument, and the resulting string is output on the standard output device.
